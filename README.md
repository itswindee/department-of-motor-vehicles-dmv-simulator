# department-of-motor-vehicles-dmv-simulator

I have created a simulation of DMV (Department of Motor Vehicles) where new customers can have their information stored into the system.

New customers can take their drivers test.

Current customers are able to renew their license and if they are moving in from out of state, the system can transfer their details from their previous city to their new city.

There is also a suspension feature where if you get a suspension, it will tell you the violation number and your name.

Every customer has their name, birth of date, what state they are moving from (if they are moving in), and what suspension they have committed (if they have committed a violation).
